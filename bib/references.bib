%Enterprise Architecture can be seen as an art; it is largely based on experience but does not have strong theoretical foundations. As a consequence, it is difficult to teach, to apply, and to support with computer-aided tools...Beyond these patterns, the methodologies have no theoretical foundations. This leads to challenges in promoting/ teaching/ applying EA and to the difficulty of developing efficient tools to support EA. 

%The traceability is the capability to make explicit the relations between related model elements found in the various levels of the enterprise model. As the purpose of EA is to integrate business and IT, this concept of traceability is essential as it allows the EA team to make explicit how the integration between the levels is realized. Explicitly establishing relationships between organizational levels is what makes EA projects original compared to other multidisciplinary projects. Firstly, despite the fact that the EA frameworks are defined to provide consistent representations of the different organizational levels, it is difficult to clearly establish and maintain the traceability between the levels. As a consequence, these frameworks are difficult to teach and apply. Secondly, there is no tool to support the use of these frameworks. So no help can be provided to the team for developing the enterprise model and, more importantly, for reusing, validating and maintaining the model. As a consequence, the development of multi-level model is tedious and discouraging. In addition, the absence of traceability in enterprise architecture frameworks yields an unbalanced architecture focused on one view .

%Enterprise architects seek to align enterprise processes and structure with their supporting IT systems so that enterprises can flourish in their environment. The enterprise architecture (EA) discipline has emerged from business best practices. EA frameworks are therefore mostly informal. As a result there is a lack of EA tools that can help enterprise architects to check this alignment. Most notably, current EA tools do not help enterprise architects to formalize the alignment of the multiple levels that constitute an enterprise model. In this paper we propose an EA framework and an associated tool that provide alignment checking along the functional and organizational hierarchies. We illustrate this approach with the Sun Microsystems industrial example of the Pet Store

%The unambiguous specification and description of components and especially their relationships in architecture requires a coherent architecture modeling language. To our knowledge at present no language exists that enables integrated modeling of architectural domains. We don't claim that architectures, and related modeling languages, alone solve the business alignment problem. Alignment involves a multitude of points of interest, which cannot always be captured by means of a modeling approach. In this paper, we put our effort in the construction of an architecture lan- guage that addresses the issue of consistent alignment. At present, we restrict our-selves mainly to modeling concepts that are related to operational aspects of an organization corresponding to the horizontal alignment discussed by Labovitz and Rosansky.15 The use of an enterprise architecture helps to chart the complexity of an organization. Many organizations have recognized the value of architectures and use them during the development and evolution of their products, processes, and systems. The goals of such an integrated model are to create insight, to aid communication between stakeholders, and to help assess the impact of changes. We do not propose a methodology or approach, but provide architects with a modeling instrument that may improve their architectural practice and allow the construction of integrated models.

%The concept of alignment is based on ideas commonly used in the Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAFs) [4, 7, 8, 9], where organization Business and IT are drawn.
%The alignment between Business and Information Systems is a key issue in every organization, given the impact it has in the overall organization. The need for repeated data insertions in different systems, the effort required to keep multiple replicas of the same information coherency and the lack of business information are common examples of such misalignment.

%Alignment between BA and IA is constant concern with providing information required to perform non-automated actions:
%Implicit decisions in business processes;
%Controlling and managing the business;
%Decision making.
%In a well aligned BA and IA, business managers spend no time searching for information that their systems could provide. An example of misalignment between BA and IA is when the client has to ask the supplier for things he is buying

%2.1.1 Information Architecture In this paper, alignment between BA and IA is restricted to the relationships between business processes and informational entities.
%Information Entities must have a way of identification (from a business perspective), a description and a set of attributes. Attributes are related to business processes and to application systems.
%The Heuristics to apply to this alignment are:
%• All processes create, update and/or delete at least one entity;
%• All entities attributes are read at least by one process;
%• All processes assume the same entity description. This means that there is a single interpretation of the entity.
%2.1.2 Alignment between Business Architecture and Application Architecture In the alignment between BA and AA, we are restricted to the relationships between business processes and application systems. Application properties are classified as availability (up time), scalability (ability to scale up performance), profile based accesses (ability to identify who does each task). The heuristics to apply to this alignment are: • Each business process should be supported by at least one application system; 
%-Business process tasks should be supported by a single application;
%• Critical business process should depend on scalable and available applications;
%• Each application system functionality should support at least one business process task.
%2.1.3 Alignment between Application Architecture and Information Architecture
%Alignment between AA and IA deals with the relationships between application systems and informational entities. When applications use information entities, the attributes should be classified as security (public, private, confidential). Information Entities must have identification. The heuristics to apply to this alignment are:
%• An entity is managed by only one application. Managed means create, assign and have identification. Other applications may update entities fields;
%• If an information entity’s ID is recovered, then the corresponding information entity should be created and deleted by the same computational process;
%• The data management should be automatic among the application systems;
%• Private entities should depend on restricted access applications;
%• Confidential entities should depend on restricted access applications;
%• The rate of updates should be correlated with rate of reads.

%Many prior studies have shown that misalignment between business and IT is one of the critical reasons why enterprises fail to get the full potential of their IT investments. The information silos, lack of business, demands from the various business units and less value of IT to business are common examples of such misalignment.

%Aligning IS/IT and business strategy is a key in maintaining business value [2], [3], [4], [5]. This alignment is not easy, neither in its conceptualization [6], [7], [8], nor in its accomplishment [7]. In fact, the lack of this alignment has been the reason for not achieve the improvement expected through their investments in IS/IT [9], [2], [10], [11].The alignment is the degree of fit and integration among business strategy, IT strategy, business infrastructure, and IT infrastructure [2].

%The alignment between business and Information Technology is a key issue in every organization. Every year, when CIOs and IT management departments are surveyed to identify their top priorities, the need for business and IT alignment appears near the top of the list.
%Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a comprehensive framework used to manage and align an organization’s IT assets, people, operations, and projects with its operational characteristics [1]. It is useful methodology to align business and IT well. And successful alignment will maximize enterprise performance and benefit organizations. Therefore, we need to explore the theory and practice of business and IT alignment and to put theory into practice based on EA.

%The enterprise willing to model its EA has to cope with two challenges. Firstly, it must define procedures for gathering the needed information. Secondly, the enterprise must devise a conceptual model defining the necessary information. The first challenge might be the more obvious one, as each enterprise forms a specific organizational context that requires dedicated information gathering procedures, etc. Nevertheless, also the conceptual model defining what the using enterprise regards an EA to be, differs from organization to organization.

%Business and IT alignment (BITA) is a major organization-wide concern that directly influences the company’s overall performance [20] and has been ranked amongst the five top concerns of the enterprise’s management executives for over a decade[7]. Such alignment assessment can be managed by EA-based approaches. Since the EA frameworks do not explicitly focus on how to do this alignment assessment, an EA-based metamodel alignment assessment guided by SBITA assessment expert’s method has been presented in previous paper and is summarized in the next chapter [11].

%Achieving alignment between business and IT requires an integrated approach to all aspects of the enterprise. Organisational effectiveness is not obtained by local optimisations, but is realised by well-orchestrated interaction of organisational components [27]. Enterprise architecture is an important instrument to address this company-wide integration. It is a coherent whole of principles, methods and models that are used in the design and realisation of the enterprise’s organisational structure, business processes, information systems, and infrastructure [1]. However, in practice, these domains are not approached in an integrated way. Every domain speaks its own language, draws its own models, and uses its own techniques and tools. Communication and decision making across domains is seriously impaired. Although some commercially available tools provide the comprehensive functionality needed to develop and maintain enterprise architecture [11], in general tools provide partial support, do not integrate with other tools and cannot be sufﬁciently conﬁgured for the enterprise’s context [13]

%This paper presents an overview of S2AEA (v2) (Strategic Alignment Assessment based on Enterprise Architecture (version2)), a platform for modelling enterprise architecture and for assessing strategic alignment based on internal enterprise architecture metrics. The idea of the platform is based on the fact that enterprise architecture provides a structure for business processes and information systems that supports them. This structure can be used to measure the degree of consistency between business strategies and information systems

%%Thus, this article presents a platform which assesses SA using the enterprise architecture. It is based on a set of metrics collected from several researches, classified according to the links between the layered structures proposed by enterprise architecture. The platform helps architects to improve the SA maturity level by (a) analyzing the structure of enterprise architecture and (b) suggesting the effort to do in order to reach a better level. processes [9], [10]. In this |article, we study the SA as harmony or correspondence between the company strategy represented by business processes and the systems supporting them. Luftman proposes a framework for measuring the alignment between a company’s strategies and the information technology strategies [11]. To illustrate an example of the use of S2AEA platform, we apply some metrics information system described in

%However, when the main concern is alignment, we may consider simpler architecture concepts and simpler methodologies because the focus is not to define development artifacts but only to check their consistency. The focus of this paper is to show how alignment between Business and IT can be stated in terms of the components found in most Enterprise Architectures. Finally, we show how alignment between Business and IT can be disaggregated into alignment between these basic components, we present general heuristics defined in terms of the architectural components and present the work in progress. We will not address the Technical Architecture; the main reason being that technical alignment is mostly dependent on the technology itself.We will address the issue of alignment based on the coherency between elements of Business Architecture, elements of Information Architecture and elements of Application Architecture. The more elements each of these Architectures has, the more rich and complex is the concept of alignment, because more rules and heuristics need to be stated to govern the relation between these elements. So, in order to build up alignment, one must first clarify the elements of each architecture. We developed Alignment's Heuristics as a common sense rule (or a set of rules) to increase the probability of finding an easier way to achieve Business, Information and Application Architectures alignment. Heuristics presented result from mapping our experience, both as academic teaching at university and professional consultancy services, into the context of the Business, Information and Application Architectures presented in this paper. We present the heuristics that we consider to have a greater value, given its simplicity and its results.

%We propose an automatic approach, relying on Model Driven Engineering (MDE), to measure such an alignment. We propose a set of measures which are formally defined using a classical axiomatization approach. We describe how these measures can be implemented with MDE techniques. We finally illustrate their use for the France-Telecom IS of telecom services. During a development based on Unified Process (UP) [2], the design of a telecom service is iterative. The task is very complex and was done manually. It led to inconsistencies, which also had to be corrected manually in an iterative loop. The use of MDA [3] helps reducing the effort to be put in this process. We propose to introduce after each UP iteration a measure of the alignment between the functional requirements analysis and the data architecture design. This measure, consistent with the MDA approach [4], enables a design optimization [5].

%In fact, any modification performed in the business process activities and/or supporting software system may impact the process activities in terms of input/output and/or purpose of the software system and, therefore, cause misalignment. A coarse grained strategy is proposed for detecting misalignment between software systems and supported business processes when a change is executed. In addition, the strategy supports the identification of all the objects, either software system components or process activities, affected by a change and needing to be considered during the evolution process, for keeping the alignment and ensuring the technological support to the business process. The strategy proposes the exploitation of quality parameters, for codifying the alignment concept, and impact analysis techniques, for propagating the change and identifying all the objects affected by a change and requiring new evolution interventions.
%The main questions to be answered for achieving this goal are: i)which is the Technological Coverage (TC) of the business process? ii)which is the Technological Adequacy of activity i (TAi) of the business process, for each activity? The alignment between business process and software system can be codified through the introduction of the thresholds Thre_TC and Thre_TAi, for each activity i. These thresholds represent the minimum wished alignment values

%The system has evolved over a period of years, and over time it has become more and more complex. Today it is no longer able to meet the diverse interests of many heterogeneous stakeholders. Problems include incomplete and inconsistent information within the system, as well as a high degree of segregation in payment processing which incur avoidable transaction costs. In the scenario, the health care provider lacks a clear business strategy to leverage technology for business improvement. This was evident in several past attempts that failed to satisfy the involved stakeholders. The complexity of the domain, together with its pressing need for business transformation represents a promising starting point for applying intentional modeling concepts for the identification of improvements to the enterprise architecture.

%Reference architectures attempt to model the structure and life cycle of complex artefacts. In their bid to tackle this complexity, architectures often employ a ‘divide and conquer’ approach, resulting in more than one model (each reflecting a particular view of the artefact modelled). Therefore, GERAM-compliant (ISO/TC184/SC5/WG1, 2000a), (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 2003) reference architectures must provide constructs and frameworks expressive enough to construct and hold these models, implying a certain degree of complexity. This complexity makes reference architectures less attractive to business users, since they also face the challenge of learning several architectures (no existing architecture framework presently covers all aspects specified by GERA). Each of these architectures potentially includes a framework, modelling methodologies, proprietary languages, etc. which further increases the necessary learning effort on the part of the users.
